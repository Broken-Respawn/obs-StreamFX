# NOT A SUBMODULE!
As AMD includes binaries in their source code repositories, and updates them as well, we opted against including their SDK as a submodule. This drastically reduces the time necessary to clone StreamFX and all dependencies, while still offering full functionality. Downside is that we need to manually update this directory every SDK update.
